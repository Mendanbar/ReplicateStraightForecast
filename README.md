Weather Face (Pebble SDK 3.0 BUILD BASALT) 
==========================================

This is a modification of Jared Biehler's "[Weather My Way](https://github.com/jaredbiehler/weather-my-way)", wrote on SDK 2.0, to add colors on SDK 3.0 BUILD BASALT.

You can see the face design is almost same to the original except for color screen with difference of 2nd weather forcast time, it is 6 hour future instead of 9 hour of original.
