Weather Face (Pebble SDK 3.0 BUILD BASALT) 
==========================================

This is a modification of Jared Biehler's "[Weather My Way](https://github.com/jaredbiehler/weather-my-way)", wrote on SDK 2.0, to add colors on SDK 3.0 BUILD BASALT.

You can see the face design that is almost same as the original except for color screen with difference of 2nd weather forcast time, it is 6 hour future instead of 9 hour of original.

Another difference is a function of vibration on Bluetooth disconnection.

Please try this and if you fovor of this, check heart sign.
